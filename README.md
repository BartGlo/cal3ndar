Goal of this task was to create page that:
1) Has clickable text field that opens a calendar with a date range.
2) After providing dates box below input appears showing:
  - Number of days between the date range
  - Is the start date and end date part of a leap year?
  - “What happened on this day” fact from the Numbers API based on the start date from the range.
<br/>
Following technologies were used:
 -React for front-end,<br/>
 -React-dates for calendar and date picking (https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates),<br/>
 -Moment.js for date calculations.<br/>
<br/>
User can enter dates either by typing in dates in format 'DD/MM/YYYY' (please provide slashes - / ) or by using provided calendar that opens automatically after clicking on the input field.
